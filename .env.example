# Osiris Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and customize as needed

# OSIRIS_HOME: Directory where Osiris stores configuration, artifacts, and outputs
# Default: ~/.osiris (in your home directory)
# Uncomment and set to customize the location:
# OSIRIS_HOME=/path/to/your/osiris-home

# For project-specific setups (recommended for tutorial examples):
# OSIRIS_HOME=./.osiris

# Notes:
# - Relative paths are resolved from your current working directory
# - Use absolute paths for shared/global Osiris installations
# - This variable can also be set in your shell profile or MCP server config
# - Claude Desktop and Claude Code can use this via MCP server env settings
