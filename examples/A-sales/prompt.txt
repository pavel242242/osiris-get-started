I want to build a sales analysis pipeline using the data in examples/A-sales/data/.

Please:
1. Load sales_q1.csv and sales_q2.csv from examples/A-sales/data/
2. Clean the data: handle any type issues, nulls, or duplicates
3. Combine both datasets
4. Calculate total revenue per category (quantity × unit_price, summed by category)
5. Save the results to outputs/revenue_by_category.parquet

Before writing the pipeline, please:
- Ask me any clarifying questions
- Explain what steps you'll take
- Show me the pipeline structure

Let me review and approve before you create it.
