I want to build a co-actor network analysis pipeline using the data in examples/B-movies/data/.

Please:
1. Load movies.csv and cast.csv from examples/B-movies/data/
2. Join the datasets to get movie-actor relationships
3. Create a co-actor matrix showing how many times each pair of actors appeared together
4. Calculate co-actor frequency (number of shared movies)
5. Save the results to outputs/coactor_network.parquet

The output should have columns: actor1, actor2, movies_together

Before writing the pipeline, please:
- Ask me any clarifying questions
- Explain what steps you'll take
- Show me the pipeline structure

Let me review and approve before you create it.
