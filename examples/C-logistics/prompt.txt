I want to build a logistics data transformation pipeline (bronze to gold) using the data in examples/C-logistics/data/.

Please create a multi-layer transformation:

Bronze layer (raw data):
1. Load shipments_raw.csv, customers_raw.csv, and shipping_costs.csv

Silver layer (cleaned & joined):
2. Clean shipments: remove cancelled shipments, validate dates
3. Join shipments with customers to get customer details
4. Calculate weight tier for each shipment (0-20, 20-30, 30+)

Gold layer (business metrics):
5. Join with shipping costs based on carrier and weight tier
6. Calculate actual shipping cost for each shipment
7. Aggregate metrics by customer: total shipments, total weight, total cost, avg cost per shipment
8. Filter to active customers only

Output:
- Save gold layer results to outputs/customer_shipping_metrics.parquet

Before writing the pipeline, please:
- Ask me any clarifying questions
- Explain the bronze-silver-gold approach
- Show me the pipeline structure

Let me review and approve before you create it.
